        <p><strong>Why I Joined Alt School:</strong> I joined Alt School because of my passion for technology, I always sought for 
        oppurtunities to expand my knowledge in technology and to help my community. When I heard about a schorlarship program
    to study at Alt school I quickly applied for it and luckily got it.
    When I learned about Alt school, I was immediately drawn to its innovative approch to education, particularly in areas of 
Engineering hence I chose to pursue frontend engineering because it was also what I started learning at school.</p>
        <p><strong>My Goals:</strong> My primary goal at Alt school is to develop a strong foundation in frontend engineering,
        focusing in mastering technologies like HTML, CSS,Javascript and modern framework. I also want to showcase my skills and creativity, 
    allowing to gain experience into my career.
I want to build professional network within Alt school community by collaborating with fellow students and learning from experienced
instructors that will prepare me to work effectively in the future.
My major goal is, I want to secure a role as a frontend engineer in a remarkable tech company where i can contribute to innovative projects.
Most importantly, I hope to contribute to the community by participating in open-source projects and sharing the knowledge I acquire with 
those at a lower level  </p>
